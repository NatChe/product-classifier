# Products classifier
The goal of this project is to perform a supervised and an unsupervised product classification based on their description and image.

## Notebooks
- [Image](Image.ipynb): unsupervised classification based on image
- [NLP](NLP.ipynb): unsupervised classification based on text
- [Classification](Classification.ipynb): supervised classification based on image


## Feature extraction from image
The following approaches were tested:
- ORB
- SIFT
- CNN (VGG16, ResNet50)

## Feature extraction from text
- Bag of Words (CountVectorizer, TF-IDF)
- Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT, USE)
